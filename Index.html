        <li>Complete Code: You on-schedule in August.</li>
        <li>Utilize my Code:You training to further my career 
            in some way: start a developer career, 
            get a job interview I wouldn't have gotten otherwise
            , or start my own business/enterprise while utilizing
            the skills I've gained at Code:You.</li>
        <li>Be more social in 2025, both professionally and personally, really get to networking.
             My little town of Whitesburg has 1200 people in it.
            It's not unreasonable that I could stronger more
            fruitful relationships with 3% of it.</li>
